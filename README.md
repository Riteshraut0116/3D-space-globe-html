## ✨ Features

*   **Interactive 3D Scene:** Built from the ground up using `three.js` for a rich WebGL experience.
*   **Dynamic Star Nucleus:** The central star animates with a mesmerizing noise displacement effect, making it feel alive.
*   **Celestial Bodies:** The scene is populated with multiple planets, a streaking comet, and a vast field of stars, all with their own textures and rotation.
*   **User Interaction:** Implements `OrbitControls` to allow users to freely rotate, pan, and zoom to explore the environment.
*   **Responsive Canvas:** The 3D scene automatically resizes to fit the browser window, ensuring a great experience on any screen size.
*   **Optimized Rendering:** The animation loop is capped at 60 FPS to ensure smooth performance without over-utilizing system resources.
